Just a jumble of my dotfiles as a record for myself.

Currently contains Vi and ZSH set ups.

Currently implemented in my set up:
  Changed from Bash to ZSH
  Installed iTerm2 Mac OS X Terminal Emulator
  Installed the BashMarks script for folder navigation:
    https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks
  Installed the ZSH Syntax Highlighting
    https://github.com/nicoulaj/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  Installed the ZSH GIT Status Prompt
    http://www.wunjo.org/zsh-git/

Usage should be as simple as copy and paste, segments are indepenent so feel free to slice and dice everything you find!
